# DHAssignment1

The project contains a folder Features, in which can be found the Specflow features files.
I reviewed the requirements and grouped them in 5 features, depending on the page
For traceability reasons every feature file starts with requirement ID and priority.
100% coverage of the requirements
For every feature there is a corresponding steps file, containing the tests.
There is also a Methods file, which contains the methods used in multiple tests
and Hooks file, caring about the wed driver starting and quitting.
My major design error is that I didn't include the Page Object design pattern from the  beginning.
I prepared everything else and thought that it would be easy to make the necessary changes quickly, but things got messy as the deadline approached.
The tests can be executed in parallel and on my environment all of them were passing
It took me 4 full days to setup, design and implement this assignment. It was very exciting and I want to thank you for this opportunity.
I had to start from scratch, and get to know and learn how to use in practice all these technologies combined together.
I know that my tests might not be very smartly written and there is a lot which can be improved,
but I am very proud that I managed to do all this on my own and thanks to the countless video tutorials and stackoverflow.
